    title: 'Baby Orion: Behind The Application'
    content: >
      The development application's source code can be found in the development
      Github Enterprise repository at
      <https://github.platforms.engineering/fst-apc-engineering/baby-orion-dev>.
      The following chapters will walk through the core queries and how to
      integrate them into the Django (or any type of) web application.

    title: About
    content: "[Baby Orion](https://fst-baby-orion.agro.services/)\_is a Django web application being developed by\_***FST APC Engineering’s Prototype and Tooling***\_team for the purpose of facilitating the analysis and reporting of Registration trials. The application consumes from the Postgres instance of\_***FST APC Engineering Data Systems***\_team’s ‘SCOUT Internal’ database. This database is synced with the SCOUT WLD server once per day.\n\n#### The\_[development dashboard](https://fst-baby-orion-dev.agro.services/)\_is an Rshiny web application developed for the purpose of validating the database queries needed for the production application. The queries employed in Baby Orion are quite complex. Thus, this bookdown seeks to create transparency about the generation and use of the queries employed in the web application.&#xA;&#xA;Sidebar &#xA;&#xA;The sidebar is a combination of four queries. The reason for partitition the sidebar data into separate queries is because of the mismatch of the granularity of the data.&#xA;\n\nEach Trial must contain one and only one of the following criteria:\n\n*   Document Type\n\n*   Category\n\n*   Study\n\n*   Status\n\n*   Region\n\nEach trial employs different product/ingredient combinations and thus the ingredient data is queried separately.\n\nEach trial also considers one or multiple types of crops/targets and thus the crop/target data is queried separately.\n\nThe data generated by these queries is\_***static***\_and loaded before the initialization of the application. Thus is it important to note that unless the application is refreshed, the sidebar data will not be synced.\n\nThe purpose of the sidebar is to allow the users of the application to identify the treatment detail of trials that meet certain filter criteria.\n\nThe standard query example will consider trials meeting the following criteria:\n\n*   Document Type: Trial\n\n*   Category: Registration\n\n*   Study: Insect Management\n\n*   Status: Final, Reviewed and Reported\n\n*   Region: EMEA\n\n*   Ingredient: FLUPYRADIFURONE\n\n*   Crop Groups: C4\n\n*   Target Groups: EHD\n\nMain Query\n\nSELECT DISTINCT\r\nmc.decode1 as document_type,\r\nmc2.decode1 as category,\r\nmc3.decode1 as study,\r\nmc4.decode1 as status,\r\nregion.region as region\r\nfrom scout_internal.field_testing ft\r\nJOIN scout_internal.master_code mc on mc.code_id = ft.field_testing_type_code_id\r\nJOIN scout_internal.master_code mc2 on mc2.code_id = ft.category_code_id\r\nJOIN scout_internal.master_code mc3 on mc3.code_id = ft.study_code_id\r\nJOIN scout_internal.master_code mc4 on mc4.code_id = ft.status_code_id\r\nleft join scout_internal.master_code mc5 on mc5.code_id = ft.field_country_code_id\r\nleft join capacity_planner.region region on region.test_location = mc5.code_value\n\nCrop Query\n\nSELECT DISTINCT\r\nMO_USE.OBJECTS AS crop_group,\r\nMO.OBJECTS AS crop\r\nFROM SCOUT_INTERNAL.CROP CROP\r\nLEFT JOIN SCOUT_INTERNAL.MASTER_OBJECTS MO ON MO.OBJECTS_ID = CROP.CROP_OBJECTS_ID\r\nLEFT JOIN SCOUT_INTERNAL.MASTER_OBJECTS MO_USE ON MO_USE.OBJECTS_ID = MO.USEGROUP_OBJECTS_ID\n\nTarget Query\n\n**SELECT** **DISTINCT**MASING.INGREDIENT**FROM**SCOUT_INTERNAL.MASTER_PRODUCT_INGREDIENT MASPROING **JOIN** SCOUT_INTERNAL.MASTER_INGR MASING **ON** MASING.INGR_ID = MASPROING.INGR_ID\n\n#### How do I paste Everything Together?&#xA;\n\n\n\n\n"
